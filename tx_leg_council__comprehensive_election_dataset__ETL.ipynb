    "## Notes\n",
    "Voting Tabulation Districts (VTDs), the census geographic equivalent of county election precincts, are created for the purpose of relating 2020 Census population data to election precinct data. VTDs can differ from actual election precincts because precincts do not always follow census geography.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the occasion that a precinct is in two noncontiguous pieces, it is a suffixed VTD in the database. For example, if precinct 0001 had two non-contiguous areas, the corresponding VTD would be VTD 0001A and VTD 0001B. If a 2022 general election precinct does not match any census geography, it is consolidated with an adjacent precinct and given that precinct's corresponding VTD number. \n",
    "\n",
    "GIS users can join election datasets to the  general election VTDs using the common field name `VTDKEY` to join the data.\n",
